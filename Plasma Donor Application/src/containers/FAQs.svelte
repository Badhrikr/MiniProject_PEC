      <p>
        Generally, plasma donors must be 18 years of age and weigh at least 110
        pounds (50kg). All individuals must pass two separate medical
        examinations, a medical history screening and testing for transmissible
        viruses, before their donated plasma can be used to manufacture plasma
        protein therapies.

      Is donating plasma safe?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p>
        Yes. Plasma donation in IQPP certified collection centers is performed
        in a highly controlled, sterile environment by professionally trained
        medical staff. All plasma collection equipment is sterilized and any
        equipment that comes into contact with you is used only once to
        eliminate the possibility of transmitting viral infections.

      What type of medical screening and testing is done?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p>
        You must have a pre-donation physical which includes answering medical
        history questions, tests for viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis and
        evaluating your protein and hemoglobin levels.

      How do you get my plasma?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p>
        Donating plasma is similar to giving blood. A needle is placed into a
        vein in your arm. Plasma is collected through a process call
        plasmapheresis and is conducted in cycles that may take up to an hour.
        Whole blood is drawn. The plasma is separated from the red blood cells
        and other cellular components. These are returned to your body with
        sterile saline solution to help the body replace the plasma removed from
        the whole blood.

    <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">Does it hurt?</div>
    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p>
        Most people compare the feeling of the needle to a mild bee sting. You
        will also be required to submit to a finger stick test each time you
        donate so the collection center medical staff can evaluate your protein
        and hemoglobin levels.
